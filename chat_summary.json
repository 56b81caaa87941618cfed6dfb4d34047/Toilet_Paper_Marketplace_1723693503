The AI offered additional features for implementation, including a slider for before and after views of product images (checked), hover-over tooltips on the T-Rex image for product details (unchecked), and a 3D model viewer (unchecked). The user also considered representations of the T-Rex, being prompted with art style options (realistic vs. cartoonish) and pose preferences (action vs. static). The user requested to add a button called \"Hadoken,\" which the AI acknowledged, and later requested to include a new form field called \"Asdf\".\n\nFurther options presented by the AI included the ability to add customizable backgrounds, with features focusing on themes such as dinosaurs and toilet paper. The user engaged with various customization options, indicating preferences for a cartoon-style dinosaur image and specific placements for the new features. The conversation also featured additional suggestions like implementing a dynamic product showcase carousel and an interactive product customization tool.\n\nThrough the discussions, a notable request was made to change the website's overarching aesthetic to a vibrant yellow background with enhanced text contrast for readability. The user then instructed to change the background to red, and subsequently, the AI facilitated a conversation about making all text streetfighter themed, which the AI promised to undertake. Overall, the exchanges revolved around enhancing the user experience through engaging visual elements, dynamic features, and playful thematic choices.",
