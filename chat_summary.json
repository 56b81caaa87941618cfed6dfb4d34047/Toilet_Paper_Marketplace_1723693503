Subsequently, the user was presented with a checklist of potential features, where several options like adjusting the color palette, adding dinosaur-themed games, and updating product descriptions to include dinosaur references were offered. Some features were already confirmed for implementation.\n\nThe user was later asked specific questions regarding their preferences for the new dinosaur image, including whether it should replace an existing image or add a new element, and whether they preferred a realistic or stylized look. The user also requested to change the image to depict a pile of toilet paper. The AI continued to provide additional features like adding high-quality product images and user-generated content sections, answering further questions about maintaining color schemes and choosing specific themes.\n\nThe user then focused on changing the website background color to red, to which the AI acknowledged and requested more details about the project. Throughout the interaction, the AI systematically gathered user preferences and suggested various UI enhancements to develop a more engaging user experience.",
