The AI then presented the user with various features to consider adding, including dynamic tooltips, a product comparison tool, and a 'Show/Hide' password toggle. The user requested to add a new button named \"Hadoken,\" which was also confirmed by the AI. Further, the user asked to add a form field labeled \"Asdf,\" and the AI noted this addition.\n\nAdditionally, the user was presented with a checklist of features such as adding customizable backgrounds and a product showcase carousel, with several items checked as desired. When asked about the T-Rex image, the AI provided options for art styles and poses, which the user navigated through, showing a preference for specific styles and actions. The conversation continued with similar inquiries about colors, themes, and functionalities, including changing the background to red and altering text to be Street Fighter-themed.\n\nUltimately, the AI successfully incorporated the requested changes and features while frequently confirming user preferences and choices, ensuring that important details and functionalities were included in the project.",
