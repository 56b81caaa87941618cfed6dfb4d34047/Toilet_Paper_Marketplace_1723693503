Furthermore, the user received two questions regarding preferences for the app's background color: whether they wanted a yellow background for the entire app or specific sections only, and if they had a specific shade of yellow in mind or were fine with any bright yellow. Subsequently, the user requested to change the background color to red, which the AI also acknowledged. The AI then sought more information regarding the user's project.",
