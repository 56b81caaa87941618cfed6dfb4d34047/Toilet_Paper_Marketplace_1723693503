The user then asked to add a button named \"Hadoken,\" which the AI also acknowledged. Following this, the user requested to add a form field called \"Asdf\" alongside the password field, which was noted by the AI. The user continued to explore various features, including a customizable background with themes and an interactive product showcase.\n\nNext, the AI provided a checklist of additional features available for implementation, highlighting several options including real-time stock updates, customer ratings, and an interactive dinosaur-themed game. The user specified preferences regarding the dinosaur image's style and placement, which the AI acknowledged while offering further customization features.\n\nAs the conversation progressed, the user made additional requests, such as changing specific images and the background color, prompting the AI to ask clarifying questions about their preferences. The user wanted features related to product images, like dynamic galleries and color contrast adjustments for better readability, which were also captured in the AI\u2019s response. Ultimately, the user specified a new background color, indicating they wanted it to be red, which the AI acknowledged by seeking further details about the project.",
